- The many schemes employed to encode the given data or `plain text`

- While communicating the data through networks , it is necessary to protect the data from unauthorised access in order to preserve the confidentiality of the data being transmitted . The encrypted data is called `cipher text`, while the algortihms applied to code or decode these messages is known as `ciphers` or `Encryption Algorithms`. The Encryption Algorithm may be classified into :
  
  - **Symmetric Encryption**
  - **Asymmetric or Public-Key Encryption**

# Symmetric Ciphers 


 - Some basic terms and definations : 
 
   1. **Plain Text :** The original message or data that is to be encrypted.
   2. **Cipher Text :** The encrypted/modified message 
   3. **Key :**  unique key , used by sender and reciever to authorise the communication , and encrypt/decrypt the data.
   4. **Encryption Algorithm :** Algorithmic operations on the `plain text` to convert it into `Cipher Text`
   5. **Dencryption Algorithm :** Reverse of the Encryption Algorithm involves operations on the `Cipher Text` to convert it into `plain text` .

- In symmetric ciphers most important consideration is to 
- Basic Considerations for Symmetric Ciphers :
  - strong encryption algorithm : such that intruder knowing the cipher algorithm , the key or the data isnt compromised.

- ## Caesar Cipher 
  
  - It is one of the most primitive type of encryption algorithm 
  - It involves the basic shift of the alphabets , by a constant factor , all the letters are displaced , such that it forms a cycle.
